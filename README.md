modular-css
===========

Provides a subset of [css-modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) via CLI/API/Browserify transform.

## Why?

CSS Modules is an amazing idea but mostly non-functional for our needs as of November 2015.

This seemed like an interesting problem and a chance to pick & choose the most attractive parts of the CSS Modules spec while leaving out parts that we found to be confusing in practice. I also wanted more experience with PostCSS and this seemed like a great way to accomplish that.
